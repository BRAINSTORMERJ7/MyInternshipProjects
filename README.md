This Python script generates strong, random passwords to enhance your online security. The password is generated with the following characteristics:
- A minimum length of 12 characters (you can change this as needed).
- At least one digit (0-9).
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
- At least one special symbol or character.

## How It Works

1. The script defines arrays of digits, uppercase characters, lowercase characters, and symbols that can be used in the password.

2. At least one character is randomly selected from each character set to ensure that the generated password meets the minimum requirements for complexity.

3. The characters selected above are combined to create a temporary password of 4 characters.

4. The script then randomly selects additional characters from the combined list of characters to reach the desired password length (in this case, 12 characters).

5. The characters are shuffled to prevent a predictable pattern in the password.

6. The shuffled characters are combined to form the final password, which is printed to the console.

## Usage

You can modify the MAX_LEN variable to generate passwords of different lengths. 

This tool can be a valuable addition to your cybersecurity practices, creating robust, unique passwords to enhance the security of your digital accounts.

*Note:* This is a simple command-line script. If you want to use it in your projects or integrate it into other applications, you can modify and adapt the code as needed.

Feel free to customize this script to meet your specific requirements or incorporate it into your own projects.
